Think Python 2e
Chapter 1 Exercises

No code is requried for any of these, but I answered them anyway.

1.1.
	1. 	In a print statement, if you leave out one or both parentheses, the interpreter will throw a
			syntax error that tells you that parentheses are missing.
	
	2. 	In a print statement, if you leave out one of the quotation marks, it will throw an error:
			
			>>> print ("Hello, world!)
			SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
	
		If you leave out both quotation marks, the result will depend on what is typed and what is defined:

			>>> print (Hello, world!)
			This returns an invalid syntax error.
	
			>>> print (slame)
			This returns a "name not defined" error. However, if we do define "slame"

			>>> slame = "4"
			>>> print (slame)
			This prints the character "4".

			>>> slame = "4"
			>>> treble = "6"
			>>> print (slame treble)
			This returns a syntax error.

	3.	Putting a plus sign in front of a number just returns that number.

		Entering the statement 2++2 just returns 4, as if you entered 2 + 2 normally.

	4. 	Typing a number with leading zeros results in an "invalid token" error being thrown.

	5. 	Typing two values with no operator between them results in a syntax error.
