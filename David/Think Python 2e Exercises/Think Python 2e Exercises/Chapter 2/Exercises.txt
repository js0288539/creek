Think Python 2e
Chapter 2 Exercises

None of these problems require code, but I'm doing them anyway.

2.1.
	1. n = 42 is a legal statement, but 42 = n is not, since you cannot assign the value of a variable to a set literal value:

		>>> 42 = n
		SyntaxError: can't assign to literal

	2. x = y = 1 is a completely legal statement. It initializes x and y as variables and sets them both equal to 1.

	3. Even though Python doesn't use semi-colons to denote the end of a line of code, putting a semi-colon at the end
		of a line of code is perfectly legal and the code will run as intended.

	4. Putting a period at the end of a statement is invalid syntax and an error will be thrown.

	5. Even if x and y are defined, entering "xy" as if you were multiplying the two together will throw an error, since
		the interpreter is looking for an "xy" variable that isn't defined. You cannot multiply two values using that
		notation in Python.
